# Operational Analytics & KPI Design for a Logistics Company

## Overview
This project focuses on transforming **raw operational data** into **clear, actionable insights** for a logistics company operating at a national scale. The goal was to improve visibility across end-to-end processes, identify inefficiencies, and support data-driven decisions without relying on spreadsheets or manual reporting.

The project was developed as part of a real business collaboration between

## Business Context
Transportes Potosinos operates in a highly operationally intensive environment where delays, rework, and lack of visibility can quickly impact customer satisfaction, costs, and employee performance.

At the time of the project:
- The company had recently migrated to a new operational system.
- Performance evaluations and bonuses varied by branch and manager.
- There was limited transparency on how operational performance was measured.
- Data existed, but it was not being fully used to guide decisions.

The challenge was not a lack of data, but **how to structure, interpret, and communicate it effectively**.

---

## Project Objective
The main objective was to design an **operational analytics approach** that:

- Standardizes KPIs across processes and regions  
- Makes operational performance visible at different levels (operator, branch, region)  
- Identifies bottlenecks, delays, and rework in logistics flows  
- Supports fair, data-based performance evaluation  
- Enables faster and more consistent decision-making

## My Role
This project was developed as part of a team. My personal contributions included:

- Analyzing operational processes across the logistics value chain  
- Defining and documenting KPIs aligned with business objectives  
- Supporting the translation of operational data into business metrics  
- Contributing to dashboard structure and metric logic  
- Turning analysis results into clear insights and recommendations  

---

## Operational Scope
The analysis covered multiple core logistics processes, including:

- Documentation and guide creation  
- Circuit loading and unloading  
- Route execution and last-mile delivery  
- Incident management (returns, damages, delays)  
- Traffic and line-haul operations  
- Finance-related operational metrics  
- Credit, billing, and collections visibility  

Each process was mapped to specific KPIs to ensure traceability between actions and outcomes.

## Data & Analytics Approach

### Business Analysis
- SWOT and PESTLE analysis to understand strategic context  
- Process mapping to identify inefficiencies and control points  
- Business model and value chain analysis  

### Data Model
- SQL-based data structure with shared keys across operational tables  
- Focus on guide lifecycle events (creation, movement, delivery)  
- Alignment between operational events and analytical metrics  

### KPIs
Examples of KPIs defined and analyzed:
- On-time delivery rate  
- Rework and re-entry rates  
- Operational delays by branch  
- Volume handled per operator  
- Incident frequency and impact  

Each KPI was clearly defined, measurable, and tied to a business decision.

---

## Dashboard & Insights
A Power BI dashboard was designed to:

- Provide a high-level operational overview  
- Allow drill-down by branch, operator, and time period  
- Highlight operational bottlenecks and risk areas  
- Support discussions around performance and improvement  

The dashboard prioritizes **clarity and usability** for operational and managerial users.

---

## Key Insights
- Certain branches showed consistently high delay and rework rates, indicating structural issues rather than isolated incidents.
- Workload concentration among a small number of operators increased error rates.
- Lack of standardized KPIs made performance comparisons across regions difficult.
- Visibility alone revealed improvement opportunities without requiring complex modeling.

---

## Business Recommendations
- Standardize operational KPIs across all branches  
- Use dashboards as a shared performance reference  
- Strengthen process controls at early stages of the logistics flow  
- Align performance evaluation with measurable outcomes  
- Improve system integration to reduce manual rework

## Tools & Skills
- Power BI (dashboard design and KPI visualization)  
- SQL (data structure understanding and metric logic)  
- Business and process analysis  
- KPI design and documentation  
- Data storytelling for non-technical stakeholders
